## Q1: Answer:
The `setTimeout()` function executes a function once given an amount of milliseconds, while `setInterval()` function executes a function multiple times.
## Q2: Answer:
when a zero delay value is passed into `setTimeout()` the function executes immediately because the second argument set to 0 tells the function to execute after 0 seconds
## Q3: Answer:
The `clearInterval()` function interupts the `setInterval()` function cycle, without it the cycle would loop forever.
